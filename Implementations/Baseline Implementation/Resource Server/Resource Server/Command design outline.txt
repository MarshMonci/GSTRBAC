Command Design Pattern For User Actions
Too superfluous for actions regarding only text files, but could be useful when other file types are included

IActivity.cs INTERFACE
	void execute()
	void undo()

TextFileActivity.cs  Implements Activity
	void ReadActivity()	
	void WriteActivity()
	void ReadWriteActivity()

PDFFileActivity.cs implements Activity
	ReadActivity()
	WriteActivity()

Resources (Receiver)
Text Files, PDF files

ABSTRACT Activity Implements IActivity
Points to resource 

ReadTextFileActivity.cs implements IActivity
	execute()
		Includes the code used to read the command
	undo()
		Simple access command, no need for undo()

WriteToTextFileActivity.cs implements IActivity
	execute()
		Include code used to write to the file
	undo()
		unimplemented, figure out how to remove text from file
 
ReadWriteTextFileActivity.cs implements IActivity
